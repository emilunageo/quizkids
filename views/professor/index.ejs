            effective! Our game allows you, as an educator, to create custom questions on a variety of subjects
            such as math, science, art, history, and more. Students can join the game, answer questions, and 
            earn points based on their performance. These points contribute to their overall ranking, motivating
            them to enhance their knowledge and engage in healthy competition with their peers. It's an excellent
            tool to assess student understanding and reinforce learning in an enjoyable and competitive 
            environment. Are you ready to inspire your students and watch them climb to the top of the leaderboard?
